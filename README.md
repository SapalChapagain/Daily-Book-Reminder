# Daily-Book-Reminder
This is the code I run daily to remind me of my favorite books quotes. Helps keeps the information fresh in my mind since I read a lot. I run this at 6:00 AM everyday using windows task scheduler. 
I have removed email addresses and passwords for safety purposes. Please update that for youself if you wish to run this code.
